# This is used to allow echoing commands that have special characters like &&.
# Instead of passing each param as an argument the entire command must be
# passed as a string. If there are multiple string arguments they are
# concatenated together by a space and eval'd as a whole.

# Note: `arr=(a b c) && echo "${(j:-:)arr}"` --> "a-b-c"

# ECHO_RUN_DEBUG: Set to "1" to output command but not run it
# ECHO_RUN_DEBUG_RETURN: Set to the desired return value of the command

# From zsh docs: "If a q- is given (only a single q may appear), a minimal form
# of single quoting is used that only quotes the string if needed to protect
# special characters. Typically this form gives the most readable output."
#
# Output the command to stderr so we can pipe the result of this to other
# commands.
